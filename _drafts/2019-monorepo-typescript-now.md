title: Zeit Now, Typescript, Monorepo
---

- It seems "monorepo" is becoming increasingly popular.
- Recently learned about Zeit
  - Lambdas and web application seems fitting for monorepo
  - DynamoDb for storage to bypass database connection pool in lambda environment
- Improve my Typescript and Jest
  - tests run automatically, result inside the editor
- Make the most of VSCode
  - vscode-eslint
  - vscode-jest
  - prettier-vscode
