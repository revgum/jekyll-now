title: Moving out.
---

I spent way too many years in Facebook and Twitter.. and, generally speaking, I don't think those platforms are healthy for people. I've thought a lot about the amount of time I've wasted, with very little benefit, just scrolling through timelines. I'll definitely miss seeing the random silly shit that a handful of friends post, for sure.

So.. I've moved out of those social media platforms and back to blogging, which I was never very consistent with anyhow. Bottom line, I've got a space to dump the thoughts and notes that I want to make public. Yay!
